# Cows-and-Bulls-Game
A simple Cows and Bulls game written in Java.

Cows and Bulls is a word game similar to Wordle. A word is picked, and you guess a word of the same length. The game will then return the numbers of cows and bulls. Bulls are letters that are correct and in the right spot, and cows that are letter that are right but in the wrong spot. A bull cannot also be a cow. You don't know which letter is a cow or bull, only that a number of cows and bulls exist. Singleplayer mode picks a random word of a chosen length from a dictionary. Multiplayer mode involves a person inputting a word as a command line argument and then giving it to another person for them to guess. To play this game, run it like a regular java file, and it will give you instructions to proceed. Make sure the dictionary and common english words files are in the same directory. If you wish to preselect a word for your friend to guess, input it as a command line argument.
